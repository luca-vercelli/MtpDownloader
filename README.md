# MtpDownloader
Download files from MTP (WPD) devices

The program is a CLI utility whose only goal is automate the following process:

* connect to a portable device via MTP protocol
* find recent files under some pre-defined paths
* download them to some local folder

It would be nice to add the following features, in future:

* to split files in folders, according to their creation date, grouped so that folders have more or less the same size
* to split images in folders, separating photos from drawings
* find and remove duplicates
